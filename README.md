# DotFiles

I keep my dotfile on github and then create symbolic links to these files. Typicall scenario on a new machine is to git clone this repo and then create symboli links to the zshrc files. 

```
ln -s ~/gihub/DotFiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

You can also clone the repo to your dropbox and only make commits when you really feel like it. :)
